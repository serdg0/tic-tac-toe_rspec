# tic-tac-toe_rspec :desktop_computer:

Using rspec we made some Test-Driven-Development to be able to test own code and ensure it's proper functionality.
  
## Getting Started -- Steps for deployment 

    # First you have to make sure you have ruby installed on your computer.
    # Install rspec gem by typing in the terminal -- > gem install rspec

## Running the tests

We are gonna run the automated tests for this system with rspec by:

* Running the root of the project in the terminal.
* Type rspec.

### What are the tests doing ?

Test the different functions in the code and check their output with their respective outcome like :

Board
  #check_cell_occupied?
    return false for an empty cell in a new board
    returns true for an occupied cell


## Built With
